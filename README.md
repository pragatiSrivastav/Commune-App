## An app for College purpose.

Manual attendance system is a tedious work to do for faculties in any educational institution. Marking attendance to managing them, a lot of efforts goes in. 
The proposed project will facilitate the access to attendance information of all students enrolled across different subjects. The task will be less time consuming now. Another purpose for developing this application is to generate the report automatically at the end of the session or in between the session.

Commune App is an android application to automate various tasks associated with handling studentsâ€™ attendance and better organizing the stored information and optimum performance, thus helping the colleges to ensure smooth working of these processes. It is relatively fast approach to enter attendance, highly reliable and efficient.
The scope of the project is the android mobile devices on which this application would be installed and it will work for a particular school or college or institution. Later on, the application can be modified for sharing documents.
