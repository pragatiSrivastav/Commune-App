Manual attendance system is a tedious work to do for faculties in any educational institution. Marking attendance to managing them, a lot of efforts goes in. 
The proposed project will facilitate the access to attendance information of all students enrolled across different subjects. The task will be less time consuming now. Another purpose for developing this application is to generate the report automatically at the end of the session or in between the session.
